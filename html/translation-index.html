          &quot;Ostensibly a nostalgic call to return to ancient Japanese virtues, &quot;The Dignity of the Nation is actually &quot;a shrill rant that blames free markets for a wide assortment of Japan's and the world's woes. &quot;Such at least was the  dismissive verdict of Time magazine in a June 2006 article entitled &quot;The Japan That Says No.&quot;<br />
          <br />
          With patriotism ceasing to be a dirty word and Japan growing ever more assertive on the world stage, this timely and provocative bestseller by mild-mannered maths professor and social commentator Masahiko Fujiwara sold more than two million copies in the original Japanese. Is the book mere demagoguery or does Fujiwara's argument that Japan should emerge from the shadow of the United States and feel pride in its own traditions and achievements carry any weight?<br /><br />

        <td><div>The Battle of Iwo Jima has been memorialized innumerable times as the subject of countless books and motion pictures, most recently Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s films Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, and no wartime photo is more famous than Joe Rosenthal&rsquo;s Pulitzer Prize-winning image of Marines raising the flag on Mount Suribachi. Yet most Americans know only one side of this pivotal and bloody battle. First published in Japan to great acclaim, becoming a bestseller and a prize-winner, So Sad to Fall in Battle shows us the struggle, through the eyes of Japanese commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi, one of the most fascinating and least-known figures of World War II.
          <p>As author Kumiko Kakehashi demonstrates, Kuribayashi was far from the stereotypical fanatic Japanese warrior. Unique among his country&rsquo;s officers, he refused to risk his men&rsquo;s lives in suicidal banzai attacks, instead creating a defensive, insurgent style of combat that eventually became the Japanese standard. On Iwo Jima, he eschewed the special treatment due to him as an officer, enduring the same difficult conditions as his men, and personally walked every inch of the island to plan the positions of thousands of underground bunkers and tunnels. The very flagpole used in the renowned photograph was a pipe from a complex water collection system the general himself engineered.</p>
          <p>Exclusive interviews with survivors reveal that as the tide turned against him, Kuribayashi displayed his true mettle: Though offered a safer post on another island, he chose to stay with his men, fighting alongside them in a final, fearless, and ultimately hopeless three-hour siege.</p>
          <p>After thirty-six cataclysmic days on Iwo Jima, Kuribayashi&rsquo;s troops were responsible for the deaths of a third of all U.S. Marines killed during the entire four-year Pacific conflict, making him, in the end, America&rsquo;s most feared&ndash;and respected&ndash;foe. Ironically, it was Kuribayashi&rsquo;s own memories of his military training in America in the 1920s, and his admiration for this country&rsquo;s rich, gregarious, and self-reliant people, that made him fear ever facing them in combat&ndash;a feeling that some suspect prompted his superiors to send him to Iwo Jima, where he met his fate. </p>
          <p>Along with the words of his son and daughter, which offer unique insight into the private man, Kuribayashi&rsquo;s own letters cited extensively in this book paint a stirring portrait of the circumstances that shaped him. So Sad to Fall in Battle tells a fascinating, never-before-told story and introduces America, as if for the first time, to one of its most worthy adversaries.</p>

The Twelve Men Who Made Japan is Sakaiya's   take on the men who created the social institutions of Japan and exerted the   greatest influence on the national psyche. His selection includes fictional   characters such as Hikaru Genji (from The Tale of Genji) whom Sakaiya regards as   the archetype of the effete aristocrats who led the country into World War II;   business leaders like Matsushita Konosuke, founder of Matsushita electronic   Industries and originator of the lifetime employment system; even General   Douglas MacArthur. Sakaiya seeks to link the habits of thought inculcated by the   twelve men to the economic malaise that bedevilled Japan throughout 1990s. This   book was specially translated for a course of lectures given by Sakaiya at Yale   in the 2003 winter semester. <br />

          During his childhood in wartime Japan, Tamiya was   obsessed with American fighter planes. It was he who persuaded his father to   diversify from selling building lumber into the manufacture of wooden models in   the late 1950s; and it was his stubbornness and fanatical attention to detail   that made Tamiya into the most highly regarded model manufacturer in the   world.<br />
          This frank autobiography covers all the highs and lows of Tamiya's   progress: the obsessive research behind the hit models; the commercial triumphs   like the original Panther tank, military miniatures, F1 racers and MINI 4WD   cars; inside stories on the development of revolutionary products like electric   R/C motors; and the rare failures, like the early Battleship Musashi.<br />
          This is   the story of an inspired hobbyist who turned his private passion into a   multi-million dollar business.<br />
