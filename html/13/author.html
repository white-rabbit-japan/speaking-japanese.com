    <meta name="description" content="Giles Murray was born in London, England in 1966. He majored in Latin, Greek and Ancient History at university. This turned out to be an excellent (if somewhat roundabout) preparation for learning Japanese. After all, if you can master a dead language with nothing but a dictionary, mastering a living language with 120 million potential conversation partners is not that hard!">

<p>Giles Murray was born in London, England in 1966. Trained originally as a classicist, 
he has been living in Tokyo since 1991. He has produced a number of original books, 
translations and online education projects which are either profiled on, or accessible 
from, this website. <br>
</p>
<p>Giles's first literary venture was an ambitious project called ACID KANJ. Consisting 
of a colour booklet with a stereo CD, ACID KANJI was designed to teach Japanese 
characters and vocabulary by linking kanji ideograms with musical archetypes. 
You can see the logos and the artwork (<i>Kanji martyrdom, Kanji lunatic asylum</i> 
etc.) on the right.</p>
<p> <a href="instant_business.html" target="_blank"><i><b>Instant Business Japanese</b></i></a> 
was published in March 1997. It was praised by the Financial Times as &quot;a 
down-to-earth insight into Japanese business&quot; and by the Asahi Evening News 
for &quot;decoding many of the idiomatic words and expressions common in the Japanese 
business world, but which are not taught at language schools.&quot; Centered around 
the story of a word-processor maker reinventing itself as a maker of cool multimedia 
PCs, <i>Instant Business Japanese</i> teaches you everything need to know to deal 
with your Japanese business counterparts on an equal footing. </p>
<p> In May 1998 Giles produced an interactive children's guidebook for the London 
Science Museum exhibition in Japan. Co-financed with the Yomiuri Shimbun, the 
guidebook was written by Julia Murray, designed by Naoko Ito (creator of this 
website), and illustrated by Peter Prout and Tadashi Nomura, who worked on <i>13 
Secrets for Speaking Fluent Japanese</i>. The user-friendly guidebook sold over 
14,000 copies. The cover, featuring Newton, Bell, Concorde and Arkwright's spinning-machine, 
is reproduced on the right. </p>
<p><i><b>13 Secrets for Speaking Fluent Japanese</b></i> was published in March 
1999. It was described as &quot;nifty, unconventional... entertaining&quot; by 
the Daily Yomiuri newspaper, and is currently in its sixth printing.<br>
<br>
May 1999 saw the publication of Giles' bilingual guide to the UK , <a href="zatsugaku.html" target="_blank"><b><i>All 
you wanted to know about the UK.</i></b></a> Giles also appeared as a presenter 
in the video version of <b><i>Japanese for Busy People</i></b> and, together with 
AJALT (Association for Japanese Language Teaching), is co-author of the Video 
Guide. <br>
<br>
In 2000 Giles and the 13 Secrets Team produced <b><i>William Blake Interactive</i></b>, 
an extensive website on William Blake for London's Tate Gallery, complete with 
audio recordings, a pop-up game and original photographs. The site was featured 
on BBC radio and selected as a USA Today "Hot Site." </p>
<p>On a more frivolous note, the next year saw the first volumes of Giles' translation 
of Ken Akamatsu's best-selling <b><i>Love Hina</i></b> comic hit the book stores. 
Eventually a total of eight bilingual comics about the adventures of the nerdy 
pervert Keitaro were published.<br>
<br>
In 2002 Giles' translation of <b><i>Master Modeler</i></b>, the autobiography 
of Shunsaku Tamiya, eponymous founder of the great model company, and <i><b>Japan 
by Numbers</b></i>, a statistical overview of Japanese society, were both published.<br>
<br>
In January 2003, <b><i>Breaking into Japanese Literature</i></b> came out. Featuring 
seven celebrated tales by Japanese masters of the short story, it provides students 
with all the back-up they need to start reading modern Japanese classics. It includes 
specially commisioned illustrations and MP3 sound files for free Internet download.<br>
