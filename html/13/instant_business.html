But <b>Instant Business Japanese</b>-as its slogan <b>'Real Life Skills for Real-life Situations' </b>proclaims- is designed to make you into something more than a stuttering stuffed shirt, by teaching you how to be articulate and persuasive.<br>						Useful expressions are taught through example sentences, and a dialogue-based story that features a couple of marketing consultants relaunching a word-processor manufacturer as a maker of cool, multimedia PCs. Humorous notes also explain some of the quirkier Japanese business practises.<br>						Praised by <b>the Financial Times</b> as 'a down to earth insight into Japanese business' and by <b>the Asahi Evening News</b> for teaching 'expressions not usually taught in language schools,' Instant Business Japanese will enable you to function as a fully versatile businessperson in a Japanese environment.</td>				</tr>				<tr></tr>				<tr height="10">					<td width="460" height="10" bgcolor="#ffffd6">						<div align="right">							<font color="#ff9c00"><b><img height="1" width="1" src="includes/images/images-yellow.gif"></b></font></div>					</td>				</tr>				<tr height="10">					<td width="130" height="10"></td>					<td width="460" height="10" align="right"><a href="javascript:window.close()"><font color="#000063"><b>Close</b></font></a></td>					<td width="10" height="10"></td>				</tr>			</table>		</center>	</body></html>
