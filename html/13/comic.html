After all, if you can master a dead language with nothing but a dictionary, mastering a living language with 120 million potential conversation partners is not that hard!">

<p>Ken Akamatsu's LOVE HINA originally appeared as a series in a Kodansha weekly 
magazine. The comic depicts the naughty escapades of the voyeuristic Keitaro, 
a teenage nerd working as the janitor of an all-girls dorm while cramming to get 
into Tokyo University. Its subject matter, which combines those twin Eastern fetishes 
of academic achievement and virginal schoolgirls, made it a huge success with 
teenage boys, and it was translated into Korean and Chinese and turned into both 
an anime television series and a series of novels.<br>
<br>
The English bilingual version of LOVE HINA is in 8 volumes (covering just under 
half of the Japanese original). Two short novels, written by Kuro Hazuki who wrote 
the screenplay for the television series, are also available in translation.<br>
<br>
<b>(1)</b> Inspired by a promise he made as a child to one of his female playmates, 
Keitaro, a puny, spectacle-wearing teenager, is studying hard to get into the 
celebrated Tokyo University. Having failed the entrance exam twice and been kicked 
out of the house by his parents, he goes to Hinata Lodge, an inn run by his grandma 
on the outskirts of Tokyo. It turns out that Hinata Lodge has become an all-girls' 
dorm, and that his grandmother is on a round-the-world trip. The girls are understandably 
hostile to Keitaro after his short-sightedness sends him on a fondling-spree in 
the girls' bath and changing room, but they finally let him stay on as janitor. 
Their change of heart is prompted in part by their mistaken belief that Keitaro 
is a student at Tokyo University, when in fact he is only studying to get in, 
with little hope of success. By chance Naru Narusegawa, sex-bomb and brain-box 
of Hinata Lodge, is studying for the same exam at the same cram school. Thus Naru 
and Keitaro's love-hate relationship gets underway.<br>

<b>(2) </b>Shinobu, the most shy and innocent of all the girls, sinks into a depression 
when she discovers that Keitaro, who had been firing her academic ambitions with 
motivational speeches, is not a Tokyo University student after all. Meanwhile 
Motoko, the sword-bearing kendo fanatic, thinks she has fallen in love with Keitaro, 
only to find out it was just the flu. Then, a dream of her brother back in India 
prompts Su, the youngest and most frolicsome of the girls, to snuggle up and hug 
Keitaro in the night, so Narusegawa justifiably punches him right out the window 
with her famed "Naru punch." Finally a low mark in his mock test prompts Keitaro 
to run away from Hinata Lodge in shame, but the girls - led by Narusegawa - get 
him back in time for the Christmas party. New Year, however, brings its own problems, 
when Kitsune - the raunchy, full-breasted girl from Osaka - gets drunk and tries 
to seduce him.<br>

<b>(3)</b> Narusegawa and Keitaro manage to take the general exam for Tokyo, despite 
originally catching a Hokkaido-bound removal van instead of the bus! The girls, 
convinced Keitaro has failed, decide to cheer him up by luring him into the outdoor 
bath with them. Concern turns to anger when they discover his results were not 
so bad after all. Valentine's Day comes around, and Keitaro bakes a splendid cake 
for himself which he pretends is a gift from a female admirer. This only prompts 
Shinobu, who feels ashamed of the meagerness of her offering, to attempt suicide. 
<br>
Keitaro gets panicky at the second stage of the Tokyo University entrance exam 
- dropping his eraser, breaking his pencil and, worst of all, breaking wind sonorously 
in the exam hall. It loooks as though he'll give up, until Narusegawa rouses his 
fighting spirit with Churchillian eloquence. Keitaro is now convinced that Narusegawa 
is none other than the girl he made the promise to all those years ago.<br>

<b>(4)</b> Keitaro sinks into depression when he discovers that Narusegawa is 
not the girl from his past. This depression only grows blacker when he discovers 
he has failed the entrance exam. Astonishingly, Narusegawa has failed too. First 
drowning their sorrows in drink, they then set out on separate trips of mental 
convalescence. It turns out, however, that they have both boarded the same train 
for Kyoto. The other girls are worried about what their depression may lead to 
and set out to search for them. In fact, they have reconciled to the point where 
they are bathing together and sharing the same bedroom (Keitaro has to tie himself 
up to repress his hanky-panky instincts). On a ferry to Kagoshima, they meet Mutsumi, 
a short-sighted and fit-prone girl from Hokkaido who has something of a crush 
on Keitaro.<br>

(5)</b> Mutsumi, Narusegawa and Keitaro set out to Okinawa in an inflatable dinghy. 
They are shipwrecked and Keitaro founds himself marooned on a beach with a pair 
of high-spirited, scantily-clad girls. After they are rescued, Mutsumi presents 
Keitaro with a turtle as a symbol of her gratitude. Narusegawa and Keitaro are 
getting romantic in a beach setting when Motoko, Kitsune, Su and Shinobu burst 
in upon them and rob Keitaro of a rare opportunity for a snog. Tama the turtle 
brings chaos and confusion as he flies about Hinata Lodge. Motoko, the samurai-like 
kendo fanatic, loses a sword-battle with Keitaro and is forced to dress in school 
uniform and be all feminine. Keitaro himself, meanwhile, goes to look for a part-time 
job. He is, of course, fired only hours after starting work.<br>

<b>(6)</b> Seta offers Keitaro a job as an assistant in the archeology department 
at Tokyo University. The downside to the job is Sarah McDogall, Seta's ward, who 
amuses herself by tormenting Keitaro. Naru has a crush on Seta (her former private 
tutor), which is bad news for Keitaro, but he can take consolation from the fact 
that even Seta - who's now an assistant professor - failed the entrance exam to 
Tokyo several times. The tense love triangle is depressurized when it is revealed 
that Seta looks on both Naru and Keitaro with paternal kindness. In the last chapter, 
all the residents of Hinata Lodge set off for the seaside where revealing swimsuits, 
wet T-shirts and having to administer the kiss of life keep Keitaro in a state 
of high excitement. <br>

(7)</b> The seaside air makes Naru friendly, and she makes unprecedented displays 
of affection towards Keitaro, showing him her tan lines and dozing off with his 
head on his shoulder. His friends, Haitani and Hirai, decide to speed things up 
by lobbing a beer can at his head to knock his head into the right position for 
a kiss. Naru, believing he was trying to take advantage of her, is furious and 
punches his lights out. Keitaro's efforts at reconciliation during a fireworks 
display are wrecked by the fireworks which drown out his conciliatory speeches. 
Things are not helped when Keitaro inadvertently rips off Naru's bikini top at 
the end of a pantomime they put on at the beach. Once again, Keitaro finds himself 
at the receiving end of a Naru punch. Keitaro goes on to be marooned on a desert 
island together with Su and Naru; to avoid Shinobu's attempt at romance by substituting 
the slimy head of Tama, the turtle, for his own lips; and to be a most reluctant 
participant in Motoko's mystical swordplay.<br>

<b>(8)</b> In this final volume of the translation, Su, in a fit of homesickness, 
does a beautiful ethnic dance on the rooftops of the dorm. Kitsune uses sophisticated 
remote-control technology to instigate a romantic clinch between Naru and Keitaro 
- with the predictable result of Keitaro getting beaten up. Kitsune then pretends 
that she fancies Keitaro in an attempt to get Naru to be honest about her feelings. 
This works and Keitaro is able to invite Naru on their first date to a kung-fu 
movie. Once again, their moment of budding intimacy is interrupted by the appearance 
of Seta and Sarah inside a fish-tank in the aquarium they are visiting! Tama the 
turtle decides to leave Hinata Lodge. Everyone sets off in pursuit and Naru and 
Keitaro bump into Mutsumi, the girl from Okinawa who first appeared in Volumes 
4 and 5. The rest of the story you will have to read in Japanese!<br>

In this 114-page saucy shocker, a rumor is going round of a treasure buried at

that all the girls in the dorm will stop at nothing to inspect his nudity. </p>
