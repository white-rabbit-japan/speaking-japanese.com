    <meta name="description" content="Giles Murray was born in London, England in 1966. He majored in Latin, Greek and Ancient History at university. This turned out to be an excellent (if somewhat roundabout) preparation for learning Japanese. After all, if you can master a dead language with nothing but a dictionary, mastering a living language with 120 million potential conversation partners is not that hard!">

<br>
</b><br>
Tokyo Fragments is a collection of short stories 
that were specially commissioned from five 
of Japan's leading contemporary writers of 
fiction. The individual tales, which are designed 
to merge to form a composite portrait of modern 
Tokyo, present the city and its inhabitants 
in all their variety, from dropout students 
sniffing glue in the sleaze of Shinjuku to 
social climbers playing at love in glitzy 
Aoyama. <br>
Tokyo Fragments includes stories by Chiya 
Fujino, winner of the Akutagawa prize in 1999, 
as well as Mariko Hayashi, Makoto Shiina, 
Tomomi Muramatsu and Ryuji Morita. <br>

<b>THE LAST FLIGHT HOME<br>
</b><br>
Published in Japanese in 1987 when the bubble 
economy was in full swing, The Last Flight 
Home was Mariko Hayashi's breakout work. Though 
it is women who are the protagonists in all 
five stories in this collection, not one of 
them conforms to the docile and saccharine 
Japanese archetype. Calculating and manipulative, 
disingenuous and overbearing, Hayashi's female 
characters live in a world where scheming 
and deception always seethe just below the 
surface. <br>
Note that although this book was published 
for Japanese students of English, the text 
has not been simplified in anyway. <br>

<b>SUBWAY LOVE</b><br>
<br>
For a period of almost ten years, from 1963 
until 1972, the young Nobuyoshi Araki obsessively 
photographed fellow passengers during his 
daily trips to and from work on the Tokyo 
subway. Yawning businessmen, dozing women, 
children who guessed what he was up to and 
mugged for the camera - Araki captured them 
all on film. His candid black and white portraits, 
shot without using the viewfinder, record 
Tokyoites of the '60s and '70s in all their 
vitality and variety. <br>
Subway Love also includes an interview with 
Araki explaining what he regards as the essence 
of documentary - 'to gaze unflinchingly at 
a thing for a long time.' <br>

<b>ARAKI BY ARAKI</b> <br>
<br>
Araki by Araki is a record of the work of 
Nobuyoshi Araki, self-styled 'photomaniac' 
and permanent enfant terrible of the Japanese 
art world. Published to mark the artist's 
sixty-third birthday, this volume features 
2002 pictures covering his entire career from 
1963 to 2002. Sex-trade voyeur, recorder of 
Tokyo cityscapes, chronicler of married life, 
or experimental photo artist - no matter what 
your image of Araki, this collection will 
reveal new aspects of his talent, as it traces 
his unique vision over 40 prolific years. 
The book includes an original commentary by 
Araki, who speaks with a unique voice, somewhere 
between Austin Powers and Keith Moon. <br>

<b>The Twelve Men Who Made Japan</b><br>
<br>
Sakaiya Taichi started out as an elite civil 
servant in Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry, 
before establishing himself as an author of 
novels, history and business books in the 
late 1970s. The Twelve Men Who Made Japan 
is Sakaiya's take on the men who created the 
social institutions of Japan and exerted the 
greatest influence on the national psyche. 
His selection includes fictional characters 
such as Hikaru Genji (from The Tale of Genji) 
whom Sakaiya regards as the archetype of the 
effete aristocrats who led the country into 
World War II; business leaders like Matsushita 
Konosuke, founder of Matsushita electronic 
Industries and originator of the lifetime 
employment system; even General Douglas MacArthur. 
Sakaiya seeks to link the habits of thought 
inculcated by the twelve men to the economic 
malaise that bedevilled Japan throughout 1990s. 
This book was specially translated for a course 
of lectures given by Sakaiya at Yale in the 
2003 winter semester. <br>

<b>Master Modeler: Creating the Tamiya Style</b> <br>
<br>
Translated from the Japanese bestseller, Master Modeler tells the story of how 
Shunsaku Tamiya turned a debt-ridden lumber business into the world's leading 
manufacturer of model kits.<br>
During his childhood in wartime Japan, Tamiya 
was obsessed with American fighter planes. 
It was he who persuaded his father to diversify 
from selling building lumber into the manufacture 
of wooden models in the late 1950s; and it 
was his stubbornness and fanatical attention 
to detail that made Tamiya into the most highly 
regarded model manufacturer in the world.<br>
This frank autobiography covers all the highs 
and lows of Tamiya's progress: the obsessive 
research behind the hit models; the commercial 
triumphs like the original Panther tank, military 
miniatures, F1 racers and MINI 4WD cars; inside 
stories on the development of revolutionary 
products like electric R/C motors; and the 
rare failures, like the early Battleship Musashi.<br>
This is the story of an inspired hobbyist who turned his private passion into 
a multi-million dollar business.<br>

<b>All You Wanted to Know about the UK</b><br>
<br>
Written by Giles Murray and translated into 
Japanese by Satsuki Kujo, All You Wanted to 
Know ... provides an overview of British life. 
<br>
A freakish mixture of hard fact and rank subjectivity, 
the book is divided into nine sections covering 
everything from sports and entertainment to 
politics and royalty. Do British people ever 
have sex? What is the British class system? 
What is the difference between British and 
American pop music? Why is British food so 
bad? What exactly are football hooligans? 
Why was Princess Diana so popular? How did 
the British Empire develop? Are the British 
really a nation of tea addicts? All these 
weighty questions glibly answered in less 
than 250 pages.<br>

<b>A Statistical Look at Japan</b><br>
<br>
Originally published in Japanese as Suji de 
Yomu Nihonjin, this abbreviated bilingual 
version of Shogo Mizoe's book provides a numbers-based 
look at every aspect of Japanese society. 
<br>
The Japanese believe in statistics. In this 
single volume, you can learn everything you 
ever wanted to know about the country: How 
frequently do couples in Tokyo have sex? By 
how much has the divorce rate risen since 
World War II? Do the Japanese live longer 
than other people? Do they work longer hours 
than any other developed nation? How does 
the Japanese murder rate compare with other 
societies? Graphs, charts and diagrams enhance 
the digestibility of this data-feast.<br>
