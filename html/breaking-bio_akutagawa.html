  <td valign="top"><div class="content_top"><span class="tbl">Akutagawa Ryunosuke was born in the Tsukiji district of Tokyo in March 1892. The 
eldest son of Niihara Toshizo, he was adopted by his uncle, Akutagawa Michiaki, 
when his mother went mad only a few months after his birth. The boy felt remote 
from both his real and his adopted parents, though the insanity of his mother 
- who lived on in his father's house, a silent, pallid figure obsessively sketching 
fox-people - was to cast a shadow over his entire life.<br />
<br />
As a child, Akutagawa was an avid reader of popular ghost stories. As a young 
student, his reading grew to cover the Chinese classics, contemporary Japanese 
authors such as Ogai and Soseki, as well as Maupassant, Anatole France, Kipling, 
Poe and other masters of the short story.<br />
<br />
Entering Tokyo Imperial University in 1913 as an English literature major, Akutagawa 
lost no time in producing original work. He had his first short story published 
in 1914, while Rashomon, his best-known tale and the title story of his first 
collection, came out the following year. 1916 marked his breakthrough, when &quot;The 
Nose&quot; was praised by Natsume Soseki and literary magazines began to court the young 
writer. <br />
<br />
The early stories are often based on old collections of tales, such as the <em>Konjaku 
Monogatari</em>, but with psychological insight and dramatic narrative techniques providing 
depth and credibility for a modern audience. One should not, however, suggest 
that Akutagawa is a realist. His stories are perfect expressions of the decadent 
aesthetic, with the gorgeous and the grotesque, the splendid and the sordid, intertwining 
in highly polished prose.<br />
<br />
After graduating in 1916, Akutagawa began teaching English at the Naval Engineering 
School in Yokosuka, but resigned in 1919, having secured a contract (just as Soseki 
had done a decade earlier) to produce fiction for a newspaper. Now married, Akutagawa 
was a popular and successful author publishing new collections of his work every 
year. <br />
<br />
<strong>Ill Health and Despair</strong><br />
In March 1921 Akutagawa was sent to China by the newspaper for which he worked. 
His health took a dramatic turn for the worse while in Shanghai. The remainder 
of his life was a tormented cocktail of insomnia, gastric problems, and paranoia 
about having inherited his mother's mental disorder. When he sought new modes 
of expression outside the short story his popularity sagged, while his extensive 
family responsibilities were also burdensome. <br />
<br />
On July 24, 1927, a physically and mentally exhausted Akutagawa killed himself 
with an overdose of barbiturates. The signs of despair are plain to see in <em>Kappa</em>, 
a superficially playful fable written just a few months prior to his death. The 
human narrator is a patient in a mental hospital: an embryo begs to be aborted 
out of fear that he will succumb to hereditary insanity: and Tok - a depressive 
poet who finally commits suicide - is regarded by many commentators as a self-portrait. <br />
<br />
Akutagawa's life was short, but his oeuvre of over 100 short stories was nonetheless 
enough to establish him as the uncontested master of the short story in modern 
Japanese literature. <br />
